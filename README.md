# Graphs

This was an excercise I had created in Ruby for my peers at App Academy. Using RSpec for guidance, those who are desirous of doing so may implement a Graph using both an Adjacency List Implementation and an Adjacency Matrix Implementation. Furthermore, they can test their own implementations of both Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm and Topological Sort.
Enjoy!
